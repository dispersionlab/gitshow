## git show

GitShow is a distributed, pro-hacking and open-source electronic music composition and instrument design experiment under development and direction by Michael Palumbo and Dr. Doug Van Nort of the Disributed Performance and Sensorial Immersion Lab (Dispersion Lab). Membership is open, and members participate by co-creating, performing, and composing for audio/visual/audiovisual instruments on a regular basis. All work contributions are done publicly and open source via github. Regular group improvisation sessions are being held on Thursday afternoons in the Dispersion Lab @ York.

The process of this project is cyclic, with each cycle spanning days or weeks as determined in advance. New members are assigned a blank repository, which they then clone to their machine. They create an instrument in max/msp, compose a text-based score for it by editing the 'README.MD' file, and record a short performance of the instrument. Returning members who participated in a previous cycle are given write privileges to another's repository. All must commit a **working version** of the instrument to the repository before the end of the cycle. Those who can be present that week will get together in the Dispersion Lab to improvise together, using the latest working version of their instruments. Shortly after, write-privileges to each repository will be reassigned to another participant, based on a method of software repository mining which also changes per each cycle. 

The experiment launched mid-January 2019, and at the time of this writing, one cycle has completed. However, it may be the case that by the time this proposal is being read, two or more cycles will have passed. This experiment is ongoing, and will be active during the time of the Vector Festival. Towards presentation as an online project, all communications, code, analysis, and research are being contemporaneously documented via the git versioning system as well as [issue threads](https://github.com/dispersionlab/gitshow/issues) and a [wiki](https://github.com/dispersionlab/gitshow/wiki) hosted on Github.com. 

As per a performance, members arrive at the venue with their laptops and soundcards, but would not find out which instrument they would be using until the beginning of the show. A screen would indicate which instrument, and in fact which version of the instrument was assigned to which performer, and at what point in its history they had worked on it. 

Please see the three .mp3 files attached with this document. They are from the 1st cycle. Subsequent recordings will be available at [https://github.com/dispersionlab/gitshow/wiki/recordings](https://github.com/dispersionlab/gitshow/wiki/recordings)
